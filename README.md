My domain idea is a exercise/health system.

    What it does:
        - It will track the user on what exercise regimen to follow
        - It will do this by date, so it will automatically change so the user knows its time to change exercise routine.
        - It will have health tips so the user knows what to eat.
        - It will have 3 different categories(i.e weight loss, muscle gain and general fitness)
        - System will automatically decide which is best for the user, there will be an option
            if the user feels he know what is best for him/her.
